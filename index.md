## About Me

I am an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University. My students and I are part of the [Shaanxi Key Lab of BDKE](https://labs.xjtudlc.com/). Our research is funded by the National Key Research Development Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation. 
 
I have previously held positions as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Ottawa and as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I obtained my Ph.D in Applied Mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zongben Xu, an esteemed  Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I am open to exploring any potential collaboration opportunities. Please let me know if you'd like to collaborate, especially if you're interested in information theoretical learning issues.

## Research
---
My research interests mainly include machine learning theory and information theory. My goal is to develop the foundational theory that guides the design of computationally efficient machine learning algorithms that do not cause degeneration.  Recently,  my research revolves around some critical challenges in big data analysis within the information theoretical learning framework, including but not limited to conducting generalization analysis for deep learning algorithms, developing novel information theoretical measures, fast approximation algorithms and corresponding statistical guarantees. Besides, I am also interested in exploring its potential applications in AI for science. 

## Recruiting
---
I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven students, who are interested in

-  Robust/Explainable machine learning, especially on coreset selection, subsampling, random sketching and kernel methods etc.
- Generalization of DNNs, aims to open the black-box of deep learning. Theoretical investigation including complexity analysis, stability analysis, SGD/SGLD analysis etc. 
- Transfer learning, including out-of-distribution generalization/Detection based on information theoretical learning framework.
-  AI for Medical, especially on pathology image analysis, drug recommendation and related topics on XAI for Medical
