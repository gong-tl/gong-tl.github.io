## About Me
---
I am an Associate Professor at the School of Computer Science and Technology at Xi'an Jiaotong University. My students and I are part of the [Shaanxi Key Lab of BDKE](https://bdkelab.xjtu.edu.cn). Our research is funded by the National Key Research Development Program of China and the National Natural Science Foundation. 
 
I have previously held positions as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Ottawa and as a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I obtained my Ph.D in Applied Mathematics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Zongben Xu, an esteemed  Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I am open to exploring any potential collaboration opportunities. Please let me know if you'd like to collaborate, especially if you're interested in information-theoretical learning issues.

## Research
---
My research focuses on statistical learning theory and information theory, aiming to develop foundational principles for computationally efficient and reliable machine learning algorithms. My current work addresses key challenges in large-scale data analysis through information-theoretical frameworks, including generalization analysis of deep learning, theoretical foundations of transfer learning and continual learning, and the development of rigorous performance guarantees. I also explore the application of these theoretical advances in AI4Science, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and practical challenges. 

## Recruiting
---
I am looking for highly motivated and self-driven students who are interested in

-  Robust/Explainable machine learning, especially on coreset selection, subsampling, random sketching etc.
- Generalization of DNNs, aims to open the black-box of deep learning. Theoretical investigation including complexity analysis,stability analysis, NTK, SGD/SGLD analysis etc. 
- Transfer/Continual learning, including out-of-distribution generalization and brain-inspired CL methods.
-  AI for Medical, especially on pathology image analysis and related topics on XAI for Medical.
